# Pliable Chocolate Ganache
This is an odd one, its chocolate ganache.... but bendy. It can make an
interesting garnish or base and can create some interesting presentations. Its
probably not interesting enough to be the main star of a dessert though

- 400g cream
- 40g glucose
- 50g water
- 1.5g Agar (or 2-3x gelatin i.e. 3.6g)
