# Tuile
This is a sweet, thin, crunchy biscuit that can be used as garnish or....you
know.... just as a biscuit.

## Ingredients
- 100g egg white
- 100g butter
- 100g plain flour
- 100g icing sugar

## Method
1. melt the butter and allow to cool a bit
2. add egg whites to butter and combine
3. seive flour into egg/butter mix
4. seive icing sugar into mixture
5. roll thin and cut into whatever funky shape takes your fancy
6. place on baking tray lined with baking paper
7. bake for 15-20 mins @180
8. take directly out of the oven and let cool
9. alternatively whilst still hot drape hot tuiles over interesting objects
   the easiest is a rolling pin, they will be malleable when warm and will cool
   in whatever shape you have draped them over.
