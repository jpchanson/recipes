# Sorbet (Alcolholic)
This is a sorbet recipe for spirit based sorbets (originally tequila but could
work equaly with any hard liquor), if i recall this sorbet works but is a bit
harder than ideal. Should probably either:
- increase glucose by 1 tbsp
- increase spirits by 1.5/2x
This will probably also work for non-spirit alcohols although in that case
might be worth reducing water to maybe 200ml-300ml and making the rest up with
the alcohol (wine, limoncello etc)

## Ingredients
- 50ml spirits
- 800ml water
- 200g sugar

## Method
1. boil water, sugar and glucose together
2. add alcohol
3. cool and $churn$
