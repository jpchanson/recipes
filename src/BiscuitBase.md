# Biscuit Base (for cheesecake)
This cheescake biscuit base is relatively fragile so worth spending a little
extra time making sure that when you assemble the cheesecake it is as compact
as possible before pouring over the cheescake mix; also serving the cheesecake
straight out of the fridge is always advisable
