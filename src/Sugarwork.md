# SugarWork
this should be used for caremelising something with desicating properties (like
salt in a deconstructed tequila slammer) or stored with a desicating agent like
silica gel.

The lemon juice is purely to avoid crystalisation, idealy we would have a
pristine pan with no imperfections for the crystals to form on (a locus of 
crystalisation) but practically this is very very hit and miss. However if you
are willing to go through the pain of having to scrap a batch or two then you
will get a much better result.

similarly the water is also not technically needed, but assuming the pan does
not heat up evenly it will reduce the liklihood of overcaremelising at the 
hotspots in the pan.

## Ingredients
- 200g sugar
- 4 drops lemon juice
- enough water to make sugar look like wet sand

# Method
- add ingredients to a small pot with a sugar thermometer
- put pot on a low heat and slowly bring it up to temperature
- the liquid will be ready for sugarwork when the temperature is higher
  than 100 degrees
- at this stage more cooking results in more colour.
